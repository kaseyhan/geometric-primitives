Geometric Primitives is an app that takes a PNG and tries to recreate it using randomly generated shapes. The result is an artistically abstract rendition of the original image; a truly modern work of art in our age of automation and artificial intelligence. Inspired by Geometrize by Sam Twidale and primitive by Michael Fogleman.
