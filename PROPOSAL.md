###What project you want to do
I would like to try recreating images with geometric primitives (https://www.samcodes.co.uk/project/geometrize-haxe-web/)

###What background knowledge do you have on this kind of project, and why do you want to do this project? (Put another way, in what way will you be motivated to see this project to completion?)
I have 13 years of experience in art, about 10 years of experience in painting, and I find this topic very interesting to explore. I attempted implementing the algorithm a couple years ago in Java but it was too difficult for me then, so I would like to try now with all the knowledge I have gained since.

###A rough timeline of what will get accomplished and when (e.g, "By the end of Week 2, I will have implemented XYZ and will start working on ABC")
By the end of Week 1, I will have decomposed the project into its foundational parts and set up its structure. I will also have researched the math behind it and begun implementing the algorithm.

By the end of Week 2, I will have implemented the visualization component of the project, actually displaying a small sample image roughly composed of geometric primitives.

By the end of Week 3, I will have scaled the project up to larger image files and added a way to save the process as a .gif so you can watch the shapes slowly form the image.

###If you were to finish the project early, what extra "stretch goals" could you implement?
I could add special options like constraining the shapes to point toward a certain point or changing the color scheme. I could also add an interactive component to upload an image of choice, choose which shape to use, and how many shapes to use.
